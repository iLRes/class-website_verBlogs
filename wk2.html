    <h1>Week Two</h1>
    <p>Design work is good. You get a designers site.</p>

    <a href="index.html">Home</a>

    <p>Designer Gleb's geometric design on the home page struck my interest; diamond shapes of grey and black, side by side, as if they were a cluster of boxes.
    When the mouse cursor hovers over the links to other pages, nothing in particular happens. However, the images in the center
    obtain a grey filter over them. Visual display is pleasing to look at, not overly bright.</p>
