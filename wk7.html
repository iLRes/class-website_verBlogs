    <p>This site is dedicated to interior designers. But, speaking for the website's design, it is clean-cut.
    Clean-cut meaning: it is sleek, gets straight to the point, no distractions from its advertising purpose.
    I found the part where the images turn pink when hovered over to be cute; it gives a bright, hospitable flair.</p>
