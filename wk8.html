    <h1>Week Eight</h1>
    <p>Design work is good. Here's a unicorn.</p>

    <p>What struck me as most interesting in this site was the Home page.
    When the site loaded, I came upon a screen with a psychedelically colored unicorn.
    When I tried to find the mouse cursor by moving it, it moved the unicorn instead.
    Conclusion: this site was programmed to be highly interactive.</p>
